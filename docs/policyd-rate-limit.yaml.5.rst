Description
===========

**policyd-rate-limit**)(8) was using a **python**)(1) style configuration file and not use a
**yaml**)(3pm) file which is reads on startup. .conf files are the old python format confguration
files and .yaml the new ones. Old style configuration files are deprecated and should not be used.

If the **--file** option if not set, it searches for configuration files on the following paths::

  ~/.config/policyd-rate-limit.conf
  ~/.config/policyd-rate-limit.yaml
  /etc/policyd-rate-limit.conf
  /etc/policyd-rate-limit.yaml

and exits if not found.
